# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge

### Group 24, Spring 2021, CS 37300, Purdue University

---

The project is to solve the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson).

### External libraries
- matplotlib. Available at https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/
- numpy. Available at https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
- pandas. Available at https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
- sklearn. Available at https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/

### How to use this project?
- Run main.py in the ./sources folder with Python 2.7
- Sample command:

```
python main.py
```

### Observations on testing
- If it's the first time running this script, it might take a while for the program to compile. Please be patient.
- The generation for the second graph takes a relatively long time. It would take more than 20 seconds while we
tested locally. If you don't want to wait, comment out that part of code.
- The code which should be commented out is highlighted, if the above situation applies.
- While the data is training, the program will print out the value of F and k to let users know that the program
is running properly
